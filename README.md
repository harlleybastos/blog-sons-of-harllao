<h2 align="center">About 📖</h2>

<p>
At first the idea of the project was actually used as a blog but it turned out that GraphCMS didn't offer a bad support for formatting all the content of the posts, not giving the possibility to format properly.

The development of this project helped me to learn a lot about TailwindCSS and NextJS so I'm posting it here on Github to use it as a portfolio.

It is also good to emphasize that the project is not my authorship.
